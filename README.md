listgen v1.0 (XML Gamelist Generator)

WHAT IS IT?
Basically my own BASH script to help you delete words in ROM filenames that stop you from scrapping for cover art, videos, etc. Great to correct ROMS for emulation environments like retrodeck or emudeck.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the BASH script and drop it in your Linux machine.
2. Give it executable rights (sudo chmod +x listgen.sh).
3. Run it: './listgen.sh'

Note: If you want it to be a global command to be run from any directory, give it executable rights, then move the file to /usr/local/bin directory.
