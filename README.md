# listgen v1.0 (XML Gamelist Generator)

WHAT IS IT?
Another of my own BASH scripts to help you generate XML Gamelists from your own ROM collections. Great for emulation environments like retrodeck or emudeck.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the BASH script and drop it in your Linux machine.
2. Give it executable rights (sudo chmod +x listgen.sh).
3. Run it: './listgen.sh'

Note: If you want it to be a global command to be run from any directory, give it executable rights, then move the file to /usr/local/bin directory.
